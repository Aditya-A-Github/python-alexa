# python-alexa
This is an Alexa clone made using Python, under constant development.<br>
It will be soon available at pip.<br>

**Instructions**
Run the code

Now, when the command line says 'listening...', start speaking.

Keep in mind that this is very very basic and only certain commands work.
For example, you could say:
"play Rick Astley"
"tell me the time"
"tell me a joke"

Any suggestions?
